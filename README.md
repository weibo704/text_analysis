# Mapping the Landscape of Generative AI Research through Web of Science
# Overview
In the rapidly evolving field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), identifying key
research themes and understanding their interconnections is crucial for academics,
practitioners, and policy makers. This project aims to utilize the comprehensive Web of
Science (WoS) database to search for publications related to generative AI. Through an
analytical approach focused on keyword co-occurrence networks derived from author
keywords, we will map the intellectual structure and identify the core themes and trends
in generative AI research.


# Tasks
1. Comprehensive Literature Retrieval: Leverage the Web of Science
database to systematically search for and retrieve publications related to
generative AI. This will involve defining a set of search terms that effectively
capture the scope of generative AI, including but not limited to terms like
"generative adversarial networks", “generative AI”
2. Keyword Co-Occurrence Network Analysis: Build a keyword
co-occurrence network from the author keywords associated with the retrieved
publications. This network will visually represent how different research themes
in generative AI are interconnected, highlighting the most frequently mentioned
and central keywords.
3. Identification of Key Research Themes: Analyze the keyword
co-occurrence network using the weighted network analysis. This will help in
understanding the focus areas of current research and predicting future trends.
